Moreover, Spinoza believes that a distinct **33** <input class="text-3"> is involved in these stages. Recent research has provided **34** <input class="text-3"> for Spinoza’s theory and it would appear that people accept all encountered information as if it were true, even if this is for an extremely **35** <input class="text-3">, and do not label the information as true or false until later.
